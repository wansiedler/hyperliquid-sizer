"""Read relayed alerts out loud on a Google Nest speaker.

A Cast device never receives audio directly — it is handed a URL and fetches
the file itself. So this module does two things: it serves the generated
speech over HTTP on the LAN, and it tells the speaker where to find it.

That is also why `TTS_HOST` must be the machine's LAN address, not localhost:
the URL is resolved by the speaker, not by us.

    CAST_HOST=192.168.1.177     # the Nest, from `dns-sd -B _googlecast._tcp`
    TTS_HOST=192.168.1.178      # this machine, as the speaker sees it
    TTS_PORT=8422               # published to the LAN in docker-compose.yml
    SPEAK_ALERTS=1              # 0 to keep the speaker quiet
    SPEAK_HOURS=23-8            # speak only from 23:00 to 8:00; empty = always
    SPEAK_LIFECYCLE=1           # say "Relay up"/"Relay down"; 0 to mute
